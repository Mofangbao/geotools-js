h1. Introduction

This is a javascript port of my geotools project, which was written in Java.

A jasmine based test suite is provided.

h1. Features

* GeoGeometry class with methods that allow you to:
** Calculate distance between two coordinates using the haversine algorithm.
** check bounding box containment for a point
** check polygon containment for a point
** get the center for a polygon
** get bounding box for a polygon
** convert circle to a polygon
** create a polygon from a point cloud
** translate a wgs84 coordinate by x & y meters along the latitude and longitude
* GeoHashUtils class with methods that allow you to: 
** encode and decode geo hashes
** check containment of a point in a geohash
** find out the boundingbox of a geohash
** find out neighboring geohashes east, west, south, or north of a geohash
** get the 32 sub geo hashes for a geohash, or the north/south halves, or the NE, NW, SE, SW quarters.
** cover lines, paths, polygons, or circles with geo hashes

h1. Changelog & releases

There is no formal release process for this project. The latest version in git that passes the provided tests should be good 
enough for general use and generally there should be no reason to use something older. I'll document major changes here.
